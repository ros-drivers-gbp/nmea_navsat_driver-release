ros-noetic-nmea-navsat-driver (0.5.2-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * Use Python's SocketServer rather than low level socket APIs. (#92 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/92>)
    This simplifies code and makes it easier to add TCP support in the future. The ``buffer_size`` parameter is no longer necessary because this is an internal detail of UDPServer.
  * Add documentation that passes ``pydocstyle``. (#88 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/88>)
  * Add an Option to Use GNSS Time and Improve Time Parsing. (#79 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/79>)
    
      * Add an optional parameter ``use_GNSS_time`` to use the time from the GPS sentences for ROS message time instead of using system time.
      * Improve GPS time parsing to support nanosecond precision on devices that support it.
      * Improve GPS time parsing to use RMC message for date when available.
      * Improve GPS time parsing to resolve ambiguities in date and century using system time.
    
  * Refactor all nodes into entrypoint scripts. (#76 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/76>).
    This will reduce the difference between ROS 1 and ROS 2 code, because ROS 2 uses Python entry points to install executables.
  * Fix PEP8 Violations (#68 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/68>). All Python modules and scripts now pass ``pycodestyle --max-line-length 120 src/libnmea_navsat_driver/ scripts/*``
  * Add ``nmea_serial_driver`` launch file (#60 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/60>)
  * Removed ``roslint`` as build depend. (#59 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/59>)
    ``roslint`` was accidentally re-added as a build dependency in #25 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/25>.

ros-noetic-nmea-navsat-driver (0.5.1-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * Add support for IMU aided GPS systems like the Applanix POS/MV, whose NMEA strings typically begin '$IN'. (e.g. $INGGA). Add support for VTG messages, which contain Course Over Ground and Speed Made Good. These are useful when not using RMC messages and you don't have a heading sensor. (#30 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/30>/#58 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/58>)
  * Add a NMEA socket driver node, which is like the existing serial driver node, but instead of attaching to a TTY handle from a serial port, it listens to a UDP port for NMEA sentences. (#32 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/32>)
  * Add code to handle serial exception to allow node to exit cleanly (#52 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/52>)
  * Cleanup CMakeLists, package.xml; using package format 2. (#28 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/28>)
  * Update maintainer to Ed Venator (#38 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/38>)
  * Add GLONASS support
  * Updated driver to accept status of 9 which some novatel recievers report for a WAAS (SBAS) fix.

  * Initial release for Hydro
  * Converted to Catkin
  * nmea_gps_driver.py is now deprecated and will be removed in I-Turtle. Replacement node is nmea_serial_driver.py .
  * Refactored code into NMEA parser, common ROS driver and separate nodes for reading directly from serial or from topic.
  * Bugs fixed:
    - nmea_gps_driver crashes when a sentence doesn't have a checksum * character ( http://kforge.ros.org/gpsdrivers/trac/ticket/4 )
    - Add ability for nmea_gps_driver to support reading from string topic ( https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_gps_driver/issues/1 ). Use the nmea_topic_driver.py node to get this support.
