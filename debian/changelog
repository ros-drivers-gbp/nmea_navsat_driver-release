ros-melodic-nmea-navsat-driver (0.5.1-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Add support for IMU aided GPS systems like the Applanix POS/MV, whose NMEA strings typically begin '$IN'. (e.g. $INGGA). Add support for VTG messages, which contain Course Over Ground and Speed Made Good. These are useful when not using RMC messages and you don't have a heading sensor. (#30 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/30>/#58 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/58>)
  * Add a NMEA socket driver node, which is like the existing serial driver node, but instead of attaching to a TTY handle from a serial port, it listens to a UDP port for NMEA sentences. (#32 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/32>)
  * Add code to handle serial exception to allow node to exit cleanly (#52 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/52>)
  * Cleanup CMakeLists, package.xml; using package format 2. (#28 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/28>)
  * Update maintainer to Ed Venator (#38 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/38>)
  * Add GLONASS support
  * Updated driver to accept status of 9 which some novatel recievers report for a WAAS (SBAS) fix.

ros-melodic-nmea-navsat-driver (0.4.0-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Initial release for Indigo
  * Fix #5: Empty fields spam rosout with warnings. Driver now outputs sensor_msgs/NavSatFix messages that may contain NaNs in position and covariance when receiving invalid fixes from the device.

ros-melodic-nmea-navsat-driver (0.3.3-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Allow the driver to output velocity information anytime an RMC message is received

ros-melodic-nmea-navsat-driver (0.3.2-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Moved to nmea_navsat_driver package
  * Removed .py extensions from new-in-Hydro scripts
  * Now uses nmea_msgs/Sentence instead of custom sentence type
  * nmea_topic_driver reads the frame_id parameter from the sentence, not from the parameter server

ros-melodic-nmea-navsat-driver (0.3.1-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Removed incorrect find_package dependencies

ros-melodic-nmea-navsat-driver (0.3.0-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Initial release for Hydro
  * Converted to Catkin
  * nmea_gps_driver.py is now deprecated and will be removed in I-Turtle. Replacement node is nmea_serial_driver.py .
  * Refactored code into NMEA parser, common ROS driver and separate nodes for reading directly from serial or from topic.
  * Bugs fixed:
    - nmea_gps_driver crashes when a sentence doesn't have a checksum * character ( http://kforge.ros.org/gpsdrivers/trac/ticket/4 )
    - Add ability for nmea_gps_driver to support reading from string topic ( https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_gps_driver/issues/1 ). Use the nmea_topic_driver.py node to get this support.

ros-melodic-nmea-navsat-driver (0.2.0-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Initial version (released into Fuerte)
  * Supports GGA or RMC+GSA sentences to generate sensor_msgs/NavSatFix messages
